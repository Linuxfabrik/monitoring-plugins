# Icinga Director

## Installing the Plugins

### Single / specific Plugins

#### By importing Baskets

For each check, we provide an Icinga Director Basket that contains at least the Command definition and a matching Service Template (for example, `check-plugins/cpu-usage/icingaweb2-module-director/cpu-usage.json`). Import this:

* either via the WebGUI using Icinga Director \> Configuration Baskets \> Upload, select the latest entry in the Snapshots tab and restore it
* or via `icingacli director basket restore < cpu-usage.json -v`

Now use the new commands within Service Templates, Service Sets and/or a Single Services.


#### By defining them manually

If you want to define plugins manually, this is how to do it (example).

Create a command for "cpu-usage" in Icinga Director \> Commands \> Commands:

* Click "+Add", choose Command type: `Plugin Check Command`
* Command name: `cmd-check-cpu-usage`
* Command: `/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/cpu-usage`
* Timeout: set it according to hints in the check's README (usually `10` seconds)
* Click the "Add" button

Tab "Arguments":

* Run `/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/cpu-usage --help` to get a list of all arguments.

* Create those you want to be customizable:

    * Argument name `--always-ok`, Value type: String, Condition (set_if): `$cpu_usage_always_ok$`
    * Argument name `--count`, Value type: String, Value: `$cpu_usage_count$`
    * Argument name `--critical`, Value type: String, Value: `$cpu_usage_critical$`
    * Argument name `--warning`, Value type: String, Value: `$cpu_usage_warning$`

Tab "Fields":

* Label "CPU Usage: Count", Field name "cpu_usage_count", Mandatory "n"
* Label "CPU Usage: Critical", Field name "cpu_usage_critical", Mandatory "n"
* Label "CPU Usage: Warning", Field name "cpu_usage_warning", Mandatory "n"


### All Plugins (Linuxfabrik Icinga Director Configuration)

To use the Linuxfabrik Icinga Director configuration, including host templates, notification templates and predefined service sets, you need to *generate* a single Icinga Director basket file containing the baskets for each check plus [all-the-rest.json](https://github.com/Linuxfabrik/monitoring-plugins/blob/main/assets/icingaweb2-module-director/all-the-rest.json). Use [tools/basket-join](https://github.com/Linuxfabrik/monitoring-plugins/blob/main/tools/basket-join) to do this.

Create the Icinga Director Basket JSON file:

* If you are using our [Fork of the Icinga Director](https://github.com/Linuxfabrik/icingaweb2-module-director), which introduced uuids, you can use the following command:

```bash
./tools/basket-join
```

* If you are NOT using our Fork of the Icinga Director, create a basket without uuids:

```bash
./tools/basket-join
./tools/remove-uuids \
    --input-file icingaweb2-module-director-basket.json \
    --output-file icingaweb2-module-director-basket-no-uuids.json
```

If you did not name your master zone `master` during the initial `icinga2 node wizard`, find and replace `"zone": "master"` with `"zone": "your-master-zone-name"` in the `icingaweb2-module-director-basket.json` file.

Import the resulting `icingaweb2-module-director-basket.json`:

* either via the WebGUI using *Icinga Director \> Configuration Baskets \> Upload*, select the latest entry in the Snapshots tab and restore it
* or via `icingacli director basket restore < icingaweb2-module-director-basket.json -v` (preferred).

If you get the error message `File 'icingaweb2-module-director-basket.json' exeeds the defined ini size.`, adjust your PHP and/or MariaDB/MySQL settings (as described in [Cant Upload Director Basket](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director/issues/2458)):

* PHP: increase `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` (if you use PHP-FPM, don't forget to restart this service).
* MariaDB/MySQL: increase `max_allowed_packet`.


## Linuxfabrik's Icinga Director Concept

### Assigning Services to Hosts

In general, all of our services are in a service set, which is then applied to a host. This is done using a tag from the `tag_list`, for example the `OS - RHEL 8 Basic Service Set` is applied to all hosts that have the `rhel8` tag set.

For some services it does not make sense to create a set, for example when monitoring an external website using `tpl-service-url`. In this case you can create a single service on that host.


### Criticality

To manage notifications we use a custom variable called `criticality`. This variable is present on both services and hosts and is used to determine if and during what time period a notification is sent.

A criticality of `A` will send a notification 7x24, `B` during business hours (5x12) and `C` never.

The criticality of the host limits the notifications that the host's services can send. This means that if you have a host with criticality `B` and a service on that host with criticality `A` has a problem, the notification will only be sent during business hours.

We try to provide reasonable default criticalities in the service templates. This means that in most cases, when adding a new host, it is sufficient to set the host criticality.

Host notifications:

| Host Criticality | Result           |
|------------------|------------------|
| `A`              | sent during 7x24 |
| `B`              | sent during 5x12 |
| `C`              | not sent         |

Service notifications:

| Host Criticality | Service Criticality | Result           |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| `A`              | `A`                 | sent during 7x24 |
| `A`              | `B`                 | sent during 5x12 |
| `A`              | `C`                 | not sent         |
| `B`              | `A`                 | sent during 5x12 |
| `B`              | `B`                 | sent during 5x12 |
| `B`              | `C`                 | not sent         |
| `C`              | `A`                 | not sent         |
| `C`              | `B`                 | not sent         |
| `C`              | `C`                 | not sent         |

Note: for the criticality to work as described here, you have to use the notification rules provided in `assets/icingaweb2-module-director/all-the-rest.json`.
