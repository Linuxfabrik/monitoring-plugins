    usage: ntp-w32tm [-h] [-V] [-c CRIT] [--test TEST] [-w WARN]

    This monitoring plugin runs `w32tm /query /status /verbose` (Windows) to help
    diagnose problems with the time settings.

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
      -c CRIT, --critical CRIT
                            Set the critical threshold for the time since "Last
                            Good Sync", in s. Default: 129600s
      --test TEST           For unit tests. Needs "path-to-stdout-file,path-to-
                            stderr-file,expected-retc".
      -w WARN, --warning WARN
                            Set the warning threshold for the time since "Last
                            Good Sync", in s. Default: 28800s


Usage Examples
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

    ./ntp-w32tm --warning 28800 --critical 129600
    
Output:

.. code-block:: text

    Leap Indicator: 3 (not synchronized), No NTP server used [WARNING], Last Sync Error: 1 (The computer did not resync because no time data was available.)

    Leap Indicator: 3(not synchronized)

    ReferenceId: 0x00000000 (unspecified)
    Last Successful Sync Time: 9/16/2023 12:52:13 PM
    Source: time.windows.com,0x8
    Poll Interval: 6 (64s)

    Phase Offset: 0.7679486s
    ClockRate: 0.0156250s
    State Machine: 0 (Unset)
    Time Source Flags: 0 (None)
    Server Role: 0 (None)
    Last Sync Error: 1 (The computer did not resync because no time data was available.)
    Time since Last Good Sync Time: 19.2218793s


States
------

* WARN if no NTP server is used.
* WARN if stratum is >= 5.
* WARN if "Leap Indicator" is not "0(no warning)"
* WARN if "Last Sync Error" is not "0"
* WARN or CRIT if "Time since Last Good Sync Time" is above a given threshold.
