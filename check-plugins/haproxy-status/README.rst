Check haproxy-status
====================

Overview
--------

This check shows you an *abundance of metrics that cover the health of your HAProxy server, current request rates, response times, and more. These metrics give you granular data on a per-frontend, backend, and server basis. You need to add a stats enable directive, which is typically put into its own frontend section.* (from https://www.haproxy.com/blog/exploring-the-haproxy-stats-page/).

HAProxy config example:

.. code-block:: text

    listen stats # Define a listen section called "stats"
        bind :9000                          # Listen on localhost:9000
        mode http
        stats auth haproxy-stats:password   # Authentication credentials
        stats enable                        # Enable stats page
        stats hide-version                  # Hide HAProxy version
        stats realm HAProxy\ Statistics     # Title text for popup window
        stats uri /server-status            # Stats URI
