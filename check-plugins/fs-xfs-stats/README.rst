Check fs-xfs-stats
==================

Overview
--------

This plugin provides some internal XFS statistics to user's view, which can be helpful on debugging/understanding IO characteristics and optimizing performance. It does not check anything.

For further information, have a look at https://xfs.org/index.php/Runtime_Stats.

    usage: fs-xfs-stats [-h] [-V]

    This check provides some internal XFS statistics to user's view, which can be
    helpful on debugging/understanding IO characteristics and optimizing
    performance.

    options:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -V, --version  show program's version number and exit


Usage Examples
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

    ./fs-xfs-stats

Output:

.. code-block:: text

    Everything is ok. Extent allocation, btree, block mapping, btree, directory operation, inode operation, vnode and read write stats collected.


States
------

* WARN if returned statistic is malformed.
* Otherwise always OK.

---------------

I/O error "No such file or directory" while opening or reading /proc/fs/xfs/stat
    VM does not use a XFS-based filesystem, instead Ext4 or other. Disable the check for this machine.
