Check whmcs-status
==================

Overview
--------

WHMCS (Web Host Manager Complete Solution) is a billing, support and automation platform designed primarily for web hosting companies and service providers. This check plugin returns the health status of a WHMCS server via its HTTP-based API, using the `GetHealthStatus API endpoint <https://developers.whmcs.com/api-reference/gethealthstatus/>`_.

Configuring API acceess and creating an API user in WHMCS is a bit tedious. First, allow IP Addresses to connect to WHMCS:

* Open https://whmcs.example.com/path/to/whmcs-admin/configgeneral.php#tab=10), Tab Security
* API IP Access Restriction > Add IP of the hosts accessing the API

Then create an administrator role with "API Access":

* Open https://whmcs.example.com/path/to/whmcs-admin/configadminroles.php
* Add New Role Group: "API Role Group"
* Grant "API Acccess" and save changes

Create an Administrator User with Role "API Access":

* Open https://whmcs.example.com/path/to/whmcs-admin/configadmins.php
* Add New Administrator
* Administrator Role: API Role Group
* First Name: WHMCS
* Last Name: Monitoring
* Username: whmcs-monitoring
* Password: set a password

Create API Credentials:

* Open https://whmcs.example.com/path/to/whmcs-admin/configapicredentials.php
* API Roles > Create API Role:

    * Role Name: GetHealthStatus
    * Allowed API Actions: Servers > GetHealthStatus

* API Credentials > Generate New API Credential

    * Admin User: WHMCS Monitoring
    * API Role(s): GetHealthStatus

Note the api_identifier and the api_secret. You will need both to configure this plugin.
