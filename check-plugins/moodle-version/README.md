# Check moodle-version

## Overview

This plugin lets you track if Moodle is End-of-Life (EOL). To compare against the current/installed version of Moodle, the check has to run on the Moodle server itself and needs access to the Moodle installation directory.

This check plugin alerts n days before or after the EOL date is reached. Optionally, it can also alert on available major, minor or patch releases (each independently).
