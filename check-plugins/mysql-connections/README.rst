Check mysql-connections
=======================

Overview
--------

Checks the connection usage rate, the rate of aborted connections and if name resolution is active for new connections on MySQL/MariaDB. Logic is taken from `MySQLTuner script <https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl>`_:mysql_stats(), v1.9.8.

    usage: mysql-connections [-h] [-V] [--always-ok]
                             [--defaults-file DEFAULTS_FILE]
                             [--defaults-group DEFAULTS_GROUP]
                             [--ignore-name-resolution] [--timeout TIMEOUT]

    Checks the connection usage rate, the rate of aborted connections and if name
    resolution is active for new connections on MySQL/MariaDB.

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
      --always-ok           Always returns OK.
      --defaults-file DEFAULTS_FILE
                            Specifies a cnf file to read parameters like user,
                            host and password from (instead of specifying them on
                            the command line), for example
                            `/var/spool/icinga2/.my.cnf`. Default:
                            /var/spool/icinga2/.my.cnf
      --defaults-group DEFAULTS_GROUP
                            Group/section to read from in the cnf file. Default:
                            client
      --ignore-name-resolution
                            Do not check if name resolution is active. Default:
                            False
      --timeout TIMEOUT     Network timeout in seconds. Default: 3 (seconds)


Usage Examples
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

    ./mysql-connections --defaults-file=/var/spool/icinga2/.my.cnf

Output:

.. code-block:: text

    0.0% aborted connections (0.0/3.1K); current 90% used (136/151, 5 threads running) [WARNING]; peak 93% used (140/151) at 2023-10-06 10:08:47; ; interactive_timeout = 1h, wait_timeout = 1; Name resolution is active [WARNING]

    Recommendations:
    * Reduce or eliminate unclosed connections and network issues.
    * Reduce or eliminate persistent connections to reduce connection usage (set connections > 10, wait_timeout < 28800 and/or interactive_timeout < 28800).
    * A reverse name resolution is made for each new connection and can reduce performance. Configure your accounts with ip or subnets only, then update your configuration with skip-name-resolve=ON.


States
------

* WARN if the number of connections is more than 85% of the maximum possible number of simultaneous client connections (setting ``max_connections``).
* WARN if the number of aborted connections is more than 3% of all client connections.
* WARN if name resolution is active (if `--ignore-name-resolution` is ommitted).

This can be due to a client using an incorrect password, a client not having privileges to connect to a database, a connection packet not containing the correct information, or if it takes more than connect_timeout seconds to get a connect packet."
    mysql_connections,                          Continous Counter,  "Value of the MySQL ``Connections`` status variable. Number of all connection attempts (both successful and unsuccessful)."
    mysql_interactive_timeout,                  Seconds,            "Value of the MySQL ``interactive_timeout`` system variable. Time in seconds that the server waits for an interactive connection (one that connects with the mysql_real_connect() CLIENT_INTERACTIVE option) to become active before closing it."
    mysql_max_connections,                      Number,             "Value of the MySQL ``max_connections`` system variable. The maximum number of simultaneous client connections."

Is inaccurate when the thread pool is in use, since each client connection does not correspond to a dedicated thread in that case."
