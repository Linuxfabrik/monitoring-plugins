# Check sensors-temperatures

## Overview

Certain hardware temperature sensors may be returned (it could be a CPU, a hard disk or something else, depending on the operating system and its configuration). All temperatures are expressed in Celsius. Checks are performed automatically against hardware thresholds. If the sensors are not supported by the OS, 'OK' is returned.

Hints:

* Run `sensors-detect --auto` beforehand to scan your system for the various hardware monitoring chips or sensors supported by libsensors or, more generally, by the lm_sensors tool suite.

## Help

```text
usage: sensors-temperatures [-h] [-V] [--always-ok]

Return certain hardware temperature sensors (it may be a CPU, an hard disk or
something else, depending on the OS and its configuration). All temperatures
are expressed in celsius. Check is done automatically against hardware
thresholds. If sensors are not supported by the OS OK is returned.

options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -V, --version  show program's version number and exit
  --always-ok    Always returns OK.
```


## Usage Examples

```bash
./sensors-temperatures
```

Output:

```text
* nvme: Composite = 42.85°C, Sensor 1 = 42.85°C
* coretemp: Package id 0 = 52.0°C, Core 0 = 50.0°C, Core 1 = 52.0°C, Core 2 = 51.0°C, Core 3 = 50.0°C, Package id 0 = 52.0°C, Core 0 = 50.0°C, Core 1 = 52.0°C, Core 2 = 51.0°C, Core 3 = 50.0°C
* iwlwifi_1: iwlwifi_1 = 46.0°
```


## States

* WARN or CRIT if temperature for a sensor is above a given hardware threshold (automatically).


## Perfdata / Metrics

* temperature for each sensor found (°C)
