       aggregate power on behalf of another device.  In such
       cases it is not known whether the usage reported is
       actual, estimated, or static.

       - actual(3):  Indicates that the reported usage was
       measured by the entity through some hardware or direct
       physical means.  The usage data reported is not estimated
       or static but is the measured consumption rate.

       - estimated(4): Indicates that the usage was not
       determined by physical measurement.  The value is a
       derivation based upon the device type, state, and/or
       current utilization using some algorithm or heuristic.  It
       is presumed that the entity's state and current
       configuration were used to compute the value.

       - static(5): Indicates that the usage was not determined
       by physical measurement, algorithm, or derivation.  The
       usage was reported based upon external tables,
