    DESCRIPTION
        "Initial version of this MIB module, as published as RFC
        7460."

PowerStateSet ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "IANAPowerState is a textual convention that describes
        Power State Sets and Power State Set Values an Energy
        Object supports.  IANA has created a registry of Power
        State supported by an Energy Object and IANA shall
        administer the list of Power State Sets and Power
        States.

        The Textual Convention assumes that Power States in a
        Power State Set are limited to 255 distinct values.  For
        a Power State Set S, the named number with the value S *
        256 is allocated to indicate the Power State Set.  For a
        Power State X in the Power State Set S, the named number
        with the value S * 256 + X + 1 is allocated to represent
        the Power State.

        Requests for new values should be made to IANA via email
        (iana@iana.org)."
