    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
        devices operating as Central Controllers (CC) that
        terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
        tunnel from Light-weight LWAPP Access Points.

        This MIB provides configuration and status information
        about the 802.11 Access Points that have joined the
        controller.                 

        The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
        can be depicted as follows:

        The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
        the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
        the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

        LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
        controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
        that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
        The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
        wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
        the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                           GLOSSARY

        Access Point ( AP )

        An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
        control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
        and provides access to the distribution services via
        the wireless medium for associated clients.  

        LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
        LWAPP frames and sends it to the controller to which
        it is logically connected.

        Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID)

        The identifier for the service set comprising of
        all the 802.11 stations under the control of
        one coordinating Access Point.  This identifier
        happens to be the MAC address of the dot11 radio
        interface of the Access Point.  The wireless
        clients that associate with the Access Point
        get the wired uplink through this particular 
        dot11 interface. 

        Central Controller ( CC )

        The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol
        tunnel from the LWAPP APs.  Throughout this MIB,
        this entity also referred to as 'controller'. 

        Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP ) 

        This is a generic protocol that defines the 
        communication between the Access Points and the
        Central Controller. 

        Mobile Node ( MN )

        A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
        network associated with an access point. 

        Station Management (SMT)

        This term refers to the internal management of the
        802.11 protocol operations by the AP to work
        cooperatively with the other APs and 802.11
        devices in the network.

        Link Latency 

        Latency is round trip time between AP and controller.
        There is a continuous heart-beat between AP and 
        controller. AP calculates latency for each time and 
        sends to controller.

        AMSDU

        Aggregate MAC Service Data Unit. A structure containing 
        multiple MSDUs, transported within a single (unfragmented)  
        or multiple (fragmented) Data MPDU. 

        DTLS

        Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol provides 
        communications privacy for datagram protocols. The protocol 
        allows client/server applications to communicate in a way 
        that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or 
        message forgery. 

        WIPS

        Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) is a network device 
        that monitors the radio spectrum for the presence of 
        unauthorized access points (intrusion detection), and can 
        automatically take countermeasures (intrusion prevention).

        SE

        Spectrum Expert is an application software, which when 
        connected to Spectrum Intelligent Access Point, provides 
        detailed RF spectrum plots and data, and assist in diagnosing 
        network problems.
