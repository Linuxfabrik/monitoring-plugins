    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module for PTPv2 (IEEE1588 - 2008)

        Overview of PTPv2 (IEEE 1588-2008)

        This IEEE standard defines a protocol enabling precise
        synchronization of clocks in measurement and control systems
        implemented with packet-based networks, the IEEE Standard PTPv2
        1588 (2008). This MIB does not address the standard IEEE
        1588 (2002). The protocol is applicable to network elements
        communicating using IP. The protocol enables heterogeneous
        systems that include clocks of various inherent precision,
        resolution, and stability to synchronize to a grandmaster
        clock.
        The protocol supports system-wide synchronization accuracy in
        the sub-microsecond range with minimal network and local clock
        computing resources. The standard uses UDP/IP. It includes
        formal mechanisms for message extensions, higher sampling
        rates, correction for asymmetry, a clock type to reduce error
        accumulation in large topologies, and specifications on how to
        incorporate the resulting additional data into the
        synchronization protocol. The standard defines conformance and
        management capability also.

        Edition 2.0 2009-02


        Definitions from [1] section 3.1

        Accuracy:
        The mean of the time or frequency error between the clock under
        test and a perfect reference clock, over an ensemble of
        measurements.  Stability is a measure of how the mean varies
        with respect to variables such as time, temperature, and so on.

        The precision is a measure of the deviation of the error from
        the mean.

        Atomic process:
        A process is atomic if the values of all inputs to the process
        are not permitted to change until all of the results of the
        process are instantiated, and the outputs of the process are
        not visible to other processes until the processing of each
        output is complete.

        Boundary clock:
        A clock that has multiple Precision Time Protocol(PTP) ports in
        a domain and maintains the timescale used in the domain.  It
        may serve as the source of time, i.e., be a master clock, and
        may synchronize to another clock, i.e., be a slave clock.

        Boundary node clock:
        A clock that has multiple Precision Time Protocol(PTP) ports in
        a domain and maintains the timescale used in the domain. It
        differs from the boundary clock in that the clock roles can
        change.

        Clock:
        A node participating in the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) that
        is capable of providing a measurement of the passage of time
        since a defined epoch.

        Domain:
        A logical grouping of clocks that synchronize to each other
        using the protocol, but that are not necessarily synchronized
        to clocks in another domain.

        End-to-end transparent clock:
        A transparent clock that supports the use of the end-to-end
        delay measurement mechanism between slave clocks and the master
        clock.  Each node must measure the residence time of PTP event
        messages and accumulate it in Correction Field.

        Epoch:
        The origin of a timescale.

        Event:
        An abstraction of the mechanism by which signals or conditions
        are generated and represented.

        Foreign master:
        An ordinary or boundary clock sending Announce messages to
        another clock that is not the current master recognized by the
        other clock.

        Grandmaster clock:
        Within a domain, a clock that is the ultimate source of time
        for clock synchronization using the protocol.

        Holdover:
        A clock previously synchronized/syntonized to another clock
        (normally a primary reference or a master clock) but now
        free-running based on its own internal oscillator, whose
        frequency is being adjusted using data acquired while it had
        been synchronized/syntonized to the other clock.  It is said to
        be in holdover or in the holdover mode, as long as it is within
        its accuracy requirements.

        Link:
        A network segment between two Precision Time Protocol ports
        supporting the peer delay mechanism of this standard.  The peer
        delay mechanism is designed to measure the propagation time
        over such a link.

        Management node:
        A device that configures and monitors clocks.

        Master clock:
        In the context of a single Precision Time Protocol
        communication path, a clock that is the source of time to which
        all other clocks on that path synchronize.

        Message timestamp point:
        A point within a Precision Time Protocol event message serving
        as a reference point in the message.  A timestamp is defined by
        the instant a message timestamp point passes the reference
        plane of a clock.

        Multicast communication:
        A communication model in which each Precision Time Protocol
        message sent from any PTP port is capable of being received and
        processed by all PTP ports on the same PTP communication path.

        Node:
        A device that can issue or receive Precision Time Protocol
        communications on a network.

        One-step clock:
        A clock that provides time information using a single event
        message.

        On-pass support:
        Indicates that each node in the synchronization chain from
        master to slave can support IEEE-1588.

        Ordinary clock:
        A clock that has a single Precision Time Protocol port in a
        domain and maintains the timescale used in the domain.  It may
        serve as a source of time, i.e., be a master clock, or may
        synchronize to another clock, i.e., be a slave clock.

        Parent clock:
        The master clock to which a clock is synchronized.


        Peer-to-peer transparent clock:
        A transparent clock that, in addition to providing Precision
        Time Protocol event transit time information, also provides
        corrections for the propagation delay of the link connected to
        the port receiving the PTP event message.  In the presence of
        peer-to-peer transparent clocks, delay measurements between
        slave clocks and the master clock are performed using the
        peer-to-peer delay measurement mechanism.


        Phase change rate:
        The observed rate of change in the measured time with respect
        to the reference time.  The phase change rate is equal to the
        fractional frequency offset between the measured frequency and
        the reference frequency.

        PortNumber:
        An index identifying a specific Precision Time Protocol port on
        a PTP node.

        Primary reference:
        A source of time and or frequency that is traceable to
        international standards.

        Profile:
        The set of allowed Precision Time Protocol features applicable
        to a device.

        Precision Time Protocol communication:
        Information used in the operation of the protocol, transmitted
        in a PTP message over a PTP communication path.

        Precision Time Protocol communication path: The signaling path
        portion of a particular network enabling direct communication
        among ordinary and boundary clocks.

        Precision Time Protocol node:
        PTP ordinary, boundary, or transparent clock or a device that
        generates or parses PTP messages.

        Precision Time Protocol port:
        A logical access point of a clock for PTP communications to the
        communications network.

        Recognized standard time source:
        A recognized standard time source is a source external to
        Precision Time Protocol that provides time and/or frequency as
        appropriate that is traceable to the international standards
        laboratories maintaining clocks that form the basis for the
        International Atomic Time and Universal Coordinated Time
        timescales.  Examples of these are Global Positioning System,
        NTP, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
        timeservers.

        Requestor:
        The port implementing the peer-to-peer delay mechanism that
        initiates the mechanism by sending a Pdelay_Req message.

        Responder:
        The port responding to the receipt of a Pdelay_Req message as
        part of the operation of the peer-to-peer delay mechanism.

        Synchronized clocks:
        Two clocks are synchronized to a specified uncertainty if they
        have the same  epoch and their measurements of the time of a
        single event at an arbitrary time differ by no more than that
        uncertainty.

        Syntonized clocks:
        Two clocks are syntonized if the duration of the second is the
        same on both, which means the time as measured by each advances
        at the same rate. They may or may not share the same epoch.

        Time of Day:


        Timeout:
        A mechanism for terminating requested activity that, at least
        from the requester's perspective, does not complete within the
        specified time.

        Timescale:
        A linear measure of time from an epoch.

        Traceability:
        A property of the result of a measurement or the value of a
        standard whereby it can be related to stated references,
        usually national or international standards, through an unbroken
        chain of comparisons all having stated uncertainties.

        Translation device:
        A boundary clock or, in some cases, a transparent clock that
        translates the protocol messages between regions implementing
        different transport and messaging protocols, between different
        versions of IEEE Std 1588-2008/IEC 61588:2009, or different
        Precision Time Protocol profiles.

        transparent clock:
        A device that measures the time taken for a Precision Time
        Protocol event message to transit the device and provides this
        information to clocks receiving this PTP event message.

        Two-step clock:
        A clock that provides time information using the combination of
        an event message and a subsequent general message.

        master but communication with the master is lost or the
        timestamps in the ptp packets are incorrect. But since the
        slave was locked to the master, it can run with the same

        sometime. The slave can continue to operate in this state for
        some time. If communication with the master is not restored for
        a while, the device is moved to the FREERUN state.

        Acquiring state. The slave device is receiving packets from a
        master and is trying to acquire a lock.

        Freq_locked state. Slave device is locked to the Master with
        respect to frequency, but not phase aligned

        Phase_aligned state. Locked to the master with respect to
        frequency and phase."
