    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
        devices operating as Central Controllers (CC) that
        terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
        (LWAPP) tunnel from Light-weight  Access Points.

        This MIB represents statistics collected for mesh node 
        in Wireless Mesh Network. 

        The deployment of the controller 
        (referred to as CC in the diagram), mesh nodes 
        (RAP and MAP) LWAPP APs, client(MS) and NMS appear 
        as follows.

        The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
        the APs. The MNs communicate with the APs through
        the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

        LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
        controllers and the controller pushes the 
        configuration, that includes the WLAN parameters to 
        the LWAPP APs. 
        The APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
        wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
        the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                           GLOSSARY

        Access Point ( AP )

        An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
        control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
        and provides access to the distribution services via
        the wireless medium for associated clients.
        LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
        LWAPP frames and sends them to the controller to which
        it is logically connected.

        Central Controller ( CC )

        The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol
        tunnel from the LWAPP APs. Throughout this MIB,
        this entity is also referred to as 'controller'.

        Mobile Station ( MS )

        A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
        network associated with an access point. Mobile Station
        and client are used interchangeably. 

        Network Management System ( NMS )

        The station from which the administrator manages the
        wired and wireless networks.

        Mesh Node

        A mesh node is defined as a physical or logical entity
        in the mesh network participating in forming the mesh 
        backhaul. RAP and MAP are two types of mesh nodes 
        supported in mesh network.

        Root AP (RAP)

        The AP forming the bridge between a wired and a mesh
        network with an Ethernet interface to the wired 
        network and a 802.11 radio interface to the mesh 
        network

        Mesh AP (MAP).

        The AP extending wireless coverage similar to a 
        repeater in a mesh network and consists of a 802.11 
        uplink and a 802.11 downlink. On a single-radio 
        backhaul, both uplink and downlink exist on the same 
        radio and are logical links only. On a multi-radio 
        backhaul, they may exist on different radios.

        Mesh Network

        Network starting with the wireless backhaul downlink
        of the RAP and all the entities below except any 
        attached network to the Ethernet link of MAPs. A mesh 
        network below a single RAP is also referred to as a 
        'Mesh Sector'.A mesh network consists of mesh nodes. 
        A single mesh network is always augmented to a single 
        wired network.

        Mesh Link

        A logical 802.11 link between two mesh nodes. A single 
        link is point-to-point. All point-to-multipoint links 
        are considered as multiple mesh links. Often referred 
        to as mesh backhaul link.

        Mesh Backhaul

        A Mesh backhaul consists of mesh nodes and mesh links 
        terminating at a RAP. This necessarily creates a one-
        to-one relationship between a 'mesh network', 'mesh
        sector' and a 'mesh backhaul' where these terms can be 
        used interchangeably.

        SNR

        Signal to Noise ratio on the 802.11 radio.

        Bridged network 

        The bridged network is defined as the network(s)
        attached to the Ethernet port of any MAP. There can be
        multiple such networks attached to a single mesh 
        network.

        Mesh Node Roaming

        A mesh node may change its parent mesh node naturally 
        when the RF/network condition changes. Child Mesh node 
        will re-associate and re-authenticate to new parent 
        mesh node. Mesh Security supports two types of mesh 
        node roaming.
           Intra-controller - LWAPP session is not lost.
           Inter-controller - LWAPP session is lost.
