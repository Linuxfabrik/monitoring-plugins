Check grassfish-players
=======================

Overview
--------

The Grassfish Platform offers a unified way to manage Digital Signage touchpoints. This monitoring plugin shows you a list of Grassfish players whose data transfer status is overdue, whose last access date is more than ``--warning`` hours ago or who are unlicensed. The list of players can be filtered. You must provide both the Grassfish hostname and a Grassfish token for this check to work.

Tested with Grassfish v1.12.

Hints:

* May take more than 10 seconds to execute.
