Check huawei-dorado-system
==========================

Overview
--------

Query basic status and performance data about a Huawei OceanStor Dorado storage system via the REST Interface, using the ``https://${ip}:${port}/deviceManager/rest/${deviceId}/system/`` endpoint. Cookies and iBaseTokens are stored and re-used (the session timeout period is usually 20 minutes).

Hints:

* Tested on Huawei OceanStor Dorado 8000 V6 6.1.0.
* Create a read-only API user that can perform query only.
* Sometimes the API returns ``This operation fails to be performed because of the unauthorized REST. Before performing this operation, ensure that REST is authorized.``, although everything is fine. In this case, the check simply tries to retrieve the data again, a maximum of 9 times within 9 seconds.

    Query basic status and performance data about a Huawei OceanStor Dorado
    storage system via the REST Interface, using the ``/system/`` endpoint.

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
      --always-ok           Always returns OK.
      --cache-expire CACHE_EXPIRE
                            The amount of time after which the credential cache
                            expires, in minutes. Default: 15
      -c, --critical CRIT   Set the CRIT threshold as a percentage. Default: >= 95
      --device-id DEVICE_ID
                            Huawei OceanStor Dorado API Device ID.
      --insecure            This option explicitly allows to perform "insecure"
                            SSL connections. Default: True
      --no-proxy            Do not use a proxy. Default: False
      --password PASSWORD   Huawei OceanStor Dorado API Password.
      --scope SCOPE         Huawei OceanStor Dorado API Scope.
      --test TEST           For unit tests. Needs "path-to-stdout-file,path-to-
                            stderr-file,expected-retc".
      --timeout TIMEOUT     Network timeout in seconds. Default: 3 (seconds)
      -u, --url URL         Huawei OceanStor Dorado API URL.
      --username USERNAME   Huawei OceanStor Dorado API Username.
      -w, --warning WARN    Set the WARN threshold as a percentage. Default: >= 90


Usage Examples
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

    ./huawei-dorado-system --url https://oceanstor:8088 --device-id 123456789 --username monitoring --password mypass

Output:

States
------

* UNKNOWN on invalid responses or responses with error codes.
* CRIT if system health status is not equal to "Normal".
* WARN if system running status is not equal to "Normal".
* WARN or CRIT if STORAGEPOOLUSEDCAPACITY in percent is above a given threshold.
* WARN or CRIT if USEDCAPACITY in percent is above a given threshold.
