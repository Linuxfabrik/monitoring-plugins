# Check network-io

## Overview

Checks the network throughput over a period of time. The check tracks the maximum throughput and warns if the throughput over the last n readings is above a certain percentage (by default 80/90% over the last 5 readings). This works similar to Load5, but at the network I/O level.

Network I/O always starts with 10 MiB/sec, but stores the highest measured throughput (rx + tx), so it adjusts the `rxtx-max/s` value accordingly. For this reason, this check takes some time to warm up its (cached) readings: The check will throw some warnings and criticals during the first major network activity above 10Mib/sec until the maximum throughput of the network has been determined.

Example: The result of `./network-io --count 5 --warning 80 --critical 90` could look like this:

```text
wlp0s20f3: 28.1MiB/s rx, 5.6KiB/s tx (current)

Interface ! rxtx-max/s ! rx1/s   ! tx1/s  ! rx5/s    ! tx5/s  ! rxtx5/s  
----------+------------+---------+--------+----------+--------+----------
tun0      ! 10.0MiB    ! 0.0B    ! 0.0B   ! 2.8B     ! 7.8B   ! 10.6B    
tun2      ! 10.0MiB    ! 183.0B  ! 106.0B ! 2.9B     ! 7.9B   ! 10.8B    
wlp0s20f3 ! 30.0MiB    ! 28.1MiB ! 5.6KiB ! 25.1 MiB ! 2.9KiB ! 25.1MiB [WARNING]
```

The first line always shows the interface with the currently highest throughput (here `wlp0s20f3`).

The table columns mean:

* rxtx-max: Here, a maximum throughput of 30.0 MiB/sec was determined.
* rx1, tx1: The current throughput is 28.1 MiB/sec (receive) and 5.6 KiB/sec (transmit).
* rx5, tx5: The throughput from now to 5 measured values in the past is 25.1 MiB/sec (receive) and 2.9 KiB/sec (transmit).
* rxtx5: Compared to the current values, there was a higher throughput for a while. Since a maximum of 30.0 MB/sec throughput has been measured for this network so far, a mean throughput (rxtx5) value of 25.1 MB/sec results in a warning (`25.1 MB/sec >= 30.0 MB/sec * 80%`). The current value of 28.1 MiB/sec doesn't matter, this is only a peak. The check alerts because there is unusual high network I/O over a certain amount of time.

Hints:

* `--count=5` (the default) while checking every minute means that the check reports a warning if any of your interfaces were above a threshold in the last 5 minutes.
* The check uses the SQLite databases `$TEMP/linuxfabrik-monitoring-plugins-network-io.db` to store its historical data.

## Help

```text
usage: network-io [-h] [-V] [--always-ok] [--count COUNT] [--critical CRIT]
                  [--ignore IGNORE] [--warning WARN]

Checks network IO.

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -V, --version    show program's version number and exit
  --always-ok      Always returns OK.
  --count COUNT    Number of times the value must exceed specified thresholds
                   before alerting. Default: 5
  --critical CRIT  Set the CRIT threshold for network I/O rx/tx rate over the
                   entire period as a percentage of the maximum network I/O
                   rate. Default: >= 90
  --ignore IGNORE  Ignore network interfaces starting with a string like "tun"
                   (repeating). Default: ['lo']
  --warning WARN   Set the CRIT threshold for network I/O rx/tx rate over the
                   entire period as a percentage of the maximum network I/O
                   rate. Default: >= 80
```

## States

* WARN or CRIT if the throughput over the last n measured values is above a certain percentage, compared to the all time maximum throughput of this interface.
