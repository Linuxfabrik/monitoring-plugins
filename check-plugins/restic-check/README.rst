Check restic-check
==================

Overview
--------

This check command tests the restic repository for errors and reports any errors it finds. In contrast to the ``restic check`` sub-command it cannot be used to read all data and therefore simulate a restore.

``restic-check`` will always load all data directly from the repository and not use a local cache, so take into account that this might take several minutes to execute, especially if the restic repository is corrupted.

Refer to the `online manual <https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for more details about restic.
