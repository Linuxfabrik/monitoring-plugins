# Check composer-version


## Overview

Checks the installed Composer version against the endoflife.date API and alerts if the version is end-of-life or if newer major, minor, or patch releases are available. By default, alerts 30 days before the official EOL date. The offset is configurable.

**Important Notes:**

* The check must run on the machine where Composer is installed
* Optionally alerts on available major, minor, or patch releases independently of EOL status via `--check-major`, `--check-minor`, and `--check-patch`

**Data Collection:**

* Runs `composer --version` at the configured `--path` (default: `/usr/bin/composer`) to determine the installed version
* Queries the endoflife.date API (`https://endoflife.date/api/composer.json`) for lifecycle data
* Caches API responses locally in an SQLite database to reduce network requests

Checks the installed Composer version against the endoflife.date API and
alerts if the version is end-of-life or if newer major, minor, or patch
releases are available. By default, alerts 30 days before the official EOL
date. The offset is configurable.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
  --always-ok           Always returns OK.
  --check-major         Alert when a new major release is available, even if
                        the current version is not yet EOL. Example: running
                        v26 (not yet EOL) and v27 is available.
  --check-minor         Alert when a new major.minor release is available,
                        even if the current version is not yet EOL. Example:
                        running v26.2 (not yet EOL) and v26.3 is available.
  --check-patch         Alert when a new major.minor.patch release is
                        available, even if the current version is not yet EOL.
                        Example: running v26.2.7 (not yet EOL) and v26.2.8 is
                        available.
  --insecure            This option explicitly allows insecure SSL
                        connections.
  --no-perfdata         Suppress the performance data section from the output.
                        The status message and the exit code are unaffected,
                        so alerting keeps working while trending data is
                        dropped.
  --no-proxy            Do not use a proxy, not even one the environment
                        names. Overrides `--proxy`.
  --offset-eol OFFSET_EOL
                        Alert n days before ("-30") or after an EOL date ("30"
                        or "+30"). Default: -30 days
  --path PATH           Local path to your composer binary. Default:
                        /usr/bin/composer
  --proxy PROXY         Proxy to reach the target through. The scheme defaults
                        to `http` when omitted. Overrides the proxy the
                        environment names (`http_proxy`, `https_proxy`,
                        `all_proxy`) together with the exceptions it lists in
                        `no_proxy`, and is itself overridden by `--no-proxy`.
                        Without either parameter the environment applies.
                        Credentials belong into the environment variable
                        rather than here, because a command-line argument is
                        visible to every user on the host. Example:
                        `--proxy=http://proxy.example.com:3128`.
  --timeout TIMEOUT     Network timeout in seconds. Default: 8 (seconds)
  --unreachable-severity {ok,warn,crit,unknown}
                        State to report when the online source is unreachable.
                        What is used instead - bundled offline data, a cached
                        copy, or nothing at all - is named in the output, and
                        a clean result then only covers what that fallback
                        could confirm. Default: ok

## Usage Examples

```bash
./composer-version --offset-eol=-30
```

Output:

```text
Composer v2.6.4 (EOL 2024-02-08 -30d [WARNING], minor 2.7.2 available, patch 2.6.6 available)
```


## States

* UNKNOWN if the Composer binary is not found at `--path`.

The end-of-life verdict, the `--check-major` / `--check-minor` / `--check-patch` alerts, `--offset-eol`, `--always-ok` and what happens when endoflife.date cannot be reached work the same way in every endoflife.date-based version plugin. They are described in [Version Plugins](https://linuxfabrik.github.io/monitoring-plugins/plugins-version/).


## Perfdata / Metrics

| Name | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| composer-version | Number | Installed Composer version as float. For example, "2.7.1" becomes "2.71". |
