Check procs
===========

Overview
--------

Prints the number of currently running processes and warns on metrics like process counts or process memory usage. You may filter the process list by process name, arguments and/or user name.

In output, process states are summarized like so:

.. csv-table::
    :widths: 25, 15, 60
    :header-rows: 1
    
    Reported            Proc State,  Description
    dead,               X,           "dead (should never be seen)"
    paging,             W,           "paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)"
    running,            R,           "running or runnable (on run queue)"
    sleeping,           "I, S",      "idle kernel thread, interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)"
    stopped,            "t, T",      "stopped by debugger during the tracing, stopped by job control signal"
    uninterruptible,    D,           "uninterruptible sleep (usually due to I/O)"
    zombies,            Z,           "defunct ('zombie') process, terminated but not reaped by its parent"

Hints:

* RSS aka "Resident Set Size" ("Res"): This is the non-swapped physical memory a process has used. On UNIX it matches "top"'s RES column. On Windows this is an alias for wset field and it matches "Mem Usage" column of ``taskmgr.exe``.
* Be aware of the differences in memory counting between different tools like top, htop, glances, GNOME System Monitor etc.
* Memory counting also changed between different Linux Kernel versions.

    Prints the number of currently running processes and warns on metrics like
    process counts or process memory usage. You may filter the process list by
    process name, arguments and/or user name.

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
      --always-ok           Always returns OK.
      --argument ARGUMENT   Filter: Search only for processes containing ARGUMENT
                            in the command, for example `-s` (case-insensitive).
      --command COMMAND     Filter: Search only for processes starting with
                            COMMAND, for example `bash` (without path, case-

Usage Examples
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

    ./procs

Output:

.. code-block:: text

    356 procs using 9.5GiB RAM (62.7%), oldest proc created 7h 44m ago, 5 running (1x glances, 1x WebExtensions, 1x systemd-resolved, 1x firefox, 1x Privileged Cont), 351 sleeping

Other examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./procs --no-kthreads --always-ok

    # warn if there are less than two or more than 100 httpd processes
    # crit if there are less than one or more than 150 httpd processes
    ./procs --command=httpd --warning=2:100 --critical=1:150

    # warn if a "duplicity" backup process runs longer than 8 hours or uses more than 50% RAM
    ./procs --command=duplicity --warning-age=28800 --warning-mem-percent=50 

    # warn if at least 1 zombie process exists
    ./procs --status=zombie --warning=0

    # count Firefox processes (Firefox's process name is "Web Content")
    ./procs --command='web content'


How to get process names
------------------------

Some process names in Python's psutil do not match the ones from ``ps aux``. To get a list with all processes, their names and details from a Python point of view, do:

.. code-block:: python

    (echo "import psutil"; echo "processes = psutil.process_iter()"; echo "for process in processes: print(process)") | python


States
------

* WARN or CRIT depending on your parameters, or if no process can be found.
