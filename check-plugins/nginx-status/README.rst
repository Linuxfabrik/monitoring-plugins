Check nginx-status
==================

Overview
--------

This check provides global nginx basic status information from the stub_status module.

For this check to work, enable the `stub_status <https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html>`_ module:

.. code-block::
    
    # /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    server {
        location /server-status {
            stub_status;
            allow 127.0.0.1;    # only allow requests from localhost
            deny all;           # deny all other hosts   
        }
    }

Due to the fact that the `stub_status <https://github.com/nginx/nginx/blob/master/src/http/modules/ngx_http_stub_status_module.c>` module increments each counter at the exact moment a new request "object" is created, even before any request header (including the URI) is parsed, there is unfortunately no way to tell Nginx not to count requests for a given URI. In other words: It is not possible to get stats only for a specific server block.

Help

.. code-block:: text

    usage: nginx-status [-h] [-V] [--always-ok] [-c CRIT] [--insecure]
                        [--no-proxy] [--timeout TIMEOUT] [-u URL] [-w WARN]
                        [--test TEST]

    This check provides NGINX basic status information.

    options:
      -h, --help           show this help message and exit
      -V, --version        show program's version number and exit
      --always-ok          Always returns OK.
      -c, --critical CRIT  Set the CRIT threshold for the number of active
                           connections. Default: >= 486
      --insecure           This option explicitly allows to perform "insecure" SSL
                           connections. Default: False
      --no-proxy           Do not use a proxy. Default: False
      --timeout TIMEOUT    Network timeout in seconds. Default: 8 (seconds)
      -u, --url URL        NGINX Server Status URL. Default:
                           http://localhost/server-status
      -w, --warning WARN   Set the WARN threshold for the number of active
                           connections. Default: >= 460
      --test TEST          For unit tests. Needs "path-to-stdout-file,path-to-
                           stderr-file,expected-retc".


Usage Examples
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

    ./nginx-status --url http://nginx/server-status --warning 460 --critical 486

Output:

.. code-block:: text

    1 active concurrent conn; 3 accepted conns, 3 handled conns, 3 reqs; 1.0 req per conn; currently 0 receiving reqs, 1 sending response, 0 keep-alive conns


States
------

* WARN if the number of total handled connections is not equal to the number of total handled requests.
* WARN or CRIT if the active connections are above the specified thresholds.
