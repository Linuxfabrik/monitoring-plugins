Check apache-httpd-status
=========================

Overview
--------

This check "allows a server administrator to find out how well their server is performing". For the check plugin to work you have to enable ``mod_status`` and set ``ExtendedStatus`` to ``On``. Have a look at https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html.

Busy workers (workers serving requests) are:

* ``C``: Closing connection
* ``D``: DNS Lookup
* ``G``: Gracefully finishing
* ``I``: Idle cleanup of worker
* ``K``: Keepalive (read)
* ``L``: Logging
* ``R``: Reading Request
* ``S``: Starting up
* ``W``: Sending Reply

Idle workers are:

* ``_``: Waiting for Connection

Free workers are:

* ``.``: Open slot with no current process

Load the Apache module:

.. code-block:: text

    LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so

If you want to configure ``/server-status`` in your main Apache config file:

.. code-block:: text

    <IfModule status_module>
        # the alias prevents the processing of .htaccess files, which could contain RewriteRules
        # that interfere with server-status
        Alias /server-status /dev/null
        ExtendedStatus On
        <Location /server-status>
            SetHandler server-status
            Require local
        </Location>
    </IfModule>

If you want to configure ``/server-status`` in a virtual host:

.. code-block:: text

    <IfModule status_module>
        ExtendedStatus On
    </IfModule>

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName localhost
        <IfModule status_module>
            # the alias prevents the processing of .htaccess files, which could contain RewriteRules
            # that interfere with server-status
            Alias /server-status /dev/null
            <Location /server-status>
                SetHandler server-status
                Require local
            </Location>
        </IfModule>
    </VirtualHost>

Help

.. code-block:: text

    usage: apache-httpd-status [-h] [-V] [--always-ok] [-c CRIT] [--insecure]
                               [--no-proxy] [--test TEST] [--timeout TIMEOUT]
                               [-u URL] [-w WARN]

    Checks how well an Apache httpd server is performing.

    options:
      -h, --help           show this help message and exit
      -V, --version        show program's version number and exit
      --always-ok          Always returns OK.
      -c, --critical CRIT  Set the CRIT threshold for the number of workers
                           processing requests in percent. Default: >= 95
      --insecure           This option explicitly allows to perform "insecure" SSL
                           connections. Default: False
      --no-proxy           Do not use a proxy. Default: False
      --test TEST          For unit tests. Needs "path-to-stdout-file,path-to-

Troubleshooting
---------------

From https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html#troubleshoot:

    The check may be used as a starting place for troubleshooting a situation where your server is consuming all available resources (CPU or memory), and you wish to identify which requests or clients are causing the problem.

    First, ensure that you have ``ExtendedStatus`` set on, so that you can see the full request and client information for each child or thread.

    Now look in your process list (using top, or similar process viewing utility) to identify the specific processes that are the main culprits. Order the output of top by CPU usage, or memory usage, depending on what problem you're trying to address.

    Reload the server-status page, and look for those process ids, and you'll be able to see what request is being served by that process, for what client. Requests are transient, so you may need to try several times before you catch it in the act, so to speak.

    This process should give you some idea what client, or what type of requests, are primarily responsible for your load problems. Often you will identify a particular web application that is misbehaving, or a particular client that is attacking your site.
