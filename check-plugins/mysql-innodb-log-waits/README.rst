Check mysql-innodb-log-waits
============================

Overview
--------

Checks the number of times InnoDB was forced to wait for log writes to be flushed due to the log buffer being too small in MySQL/MariaDB. Logic is taken from `MySQLTuner script <https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl>`_:mysql_innodb(), v1.8.3.

    usage: mysql-innodb-log-waits [-h] [-V] [--always-ok]
                                  [--defaults-file DEFAULTS_FILE]
                                  [--defaults-group DEFAULTS_GROUP]
                                  [--timeout TIMEOUT]

    Checks the number of times InnoDB was forced to wait for log writes to be
    flushed due to the log buffer being too small in MySQL/MariaDB.

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
      --always-ok           Always returns OK.
      --defaults-file DEFAULTS_FILE
                            Specifies a cnf file to read parameters like user,
                            host and password from (instead of specifying them on
                            the command line), for example
                            `/var/spool/icinga2/.my.cnf`. Default:
                            /var/spool/icinga2/.my.cnf
      --defaults-group DEFAULTS_GROUP
                            Group/section to read from in the cnf file. Default:
                            client
      --timeout TIMEOUT     Network timeout in seconds. Default: 3 (seconds)


Usage Examples
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

    ./mysql-innodb-log-waits --defaults-file=/var/spool/icinga2/.my.cnf

Output:

.. code-block:: text

    0.0 InnoDB log buffer waits / 867.6K writes.


States
------

* WARN if the number of times InnoDB was forced to wait for log writes to be flushed is > 0.
