Check mysql-slow-queries
========================

Overview
--------

Checks the slow query log, which is a record of SQL queries that took a long time to perform on MySQL/MariaDB. Logic is taken from `MySQLTuner script <https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl>`_:mysql_stats(), v1.9.8.

                              [--defaults-group DEFAULTS_GROUP]
                              [--timeout TIMEOUT]

    Checks the slow query log, which is a record of SQL queries that took a long

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit

      --defaults-file DEFAULTS_FILE
                            Specifies a cnf file to read parameters like user,
                            host and password from (instead of specifying them on

      --defaults-group DEFAULTS_GROUP
                            Group/section to read from in the cnf file. Default:
                            client
      --timeout TIMEOUT     Network timeout in seconds. Default: 3 (seconds)


Usage Examples
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

    ./mysql-slow-queries --defaults-file=/var/spool/icinga2/.my.cnf

Output:

.. code-block:: text

    Slow queries: 7.0% (7.0 slow queries/100.0 questions) [WARNING]. Set long_query_time <= 10. Enable the slow_query_log to troubleshoot bad queries.


States
------

* WARN if the number of slow queries is more than 5% of all queries.
