# Overview Section of a Monitoring Plugins' README

If you have to improve or write the overview section of a monitoring plugin, analyze the code of the plugin, and analyze the used library functions from the plugins' "lib" folder. The key improvements should be:

Structure:
* Organized into three clear sections: Alerting Logic, Data Collection, and Compatibility
* Appends "Important Notes" if applicable
* Uses bullet points for scanability

Clarity:
* Leading sentence immediately states the main purpose
* Alerting Logic section clearly explains which metrics trigger alerts and the consecutive run requirement
* Explicitly states specific behaviour in certain situations

Precision:
* Explains special technical features
* Lists which specific fields trigger alerts
* Mentions specific SQLite features and references the actual SQLite database path

Target Audience:
* Assumes familiarity with Nagios/Icinga. BTW: No need to mention "perfdata output is for graphing" or "Full perfdata output for all metrics in Nagios/Icinga".
* Uses technical terminology appropriate for experienced sysadmins (context switches, non-blocking measurement, state
persistence)
* Focuses on operational aspects: alerting behavior, data collection method, compatibility

The new overview gives administrators the essential information they need to understand how the check behaves in
production before deploying it.
